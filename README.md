<b>About this Project:</b>

In this Project, I have just created the Database and Several tables without any values inserted into it. 
This database is ready to use and it is input friendly, where the datas are inserted freshly at the frontend of the website.
This is built with primary key and foreign key to connect all the tables in the database.
